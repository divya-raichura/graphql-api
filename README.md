# graphql-api

- a simple application which uses 
`
graphql,
apollo-client and
apollo-server
`
- apollo-client in the frontend is used to fetch data using hooks like `uselazyQuery` and `useQuery`
- `useMutation` is used so that new data can be added.
- ui re-renders when new data is added
- no fancy css, just pure `react` and `graphQL`
- apollo-server is used in backend for graphQL api
